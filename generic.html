          <h2>Summary of the Learning Outcomes of the Module</h2>
          <p>
            The Security and Risk Management module provided an in-depth
            exploration of the theoretical frameworks, practical tools, and
            methodologies used in contemporary risk management. A key learning
            outcome was understanding and applying risk management frameworks,
            particularly NIST SP 800-30 and the STRIDE model, to assess and
            mitigate risks systematically. These tools facilitated identifying
            vulnerabilities in both current systems and proposed changes, such
            as transitioning to e-commerce and adopting international supply
            chains.
          </p>
          <p>
            The module also emphasized quantitative risk modeling, introducing
            techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate risks
            probabilistically. This approach allowed a nuanced understanding of
            risk likelihood and potential impacts, equipping learners to
            prioritize mitigation strategies effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            A significant focus was placed on business continuity and disaster
            recovery (DR) planning. By analyzing RPO (Recovery Point Objectives)
            and RTO (Recovery Time Objectives), participants gained insights
            into minimizing operational downtime and ensuring data integrity
            during disruptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the module highlighted the importance of adhering to
            industry standards, such as GDPR, and aligning organizational
            practices with regulatory requirements. This knowledge is invaluable
            for balancing operational efficiency with legal compliance. Overall,
            the module prepared learners to address security and risk management
            challenges holistically, combining theoretical understanding with
            practical applications.
          </p>

              <strong>Reflective Report (Unit 12)</strong>
              <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
              <p>
                The reflective report provided insights into learning
                experiences throughout the module, structured using the "What?,
                So What?, Now What?" framework. It highlighted the application
                of theoretical knowledge, the development of practical skills,
                and lessons learned from collaborative and individual projects.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Reflective Piece</h2>
          <h3>What?</h3>
          <p>
            The module facilitated a hands-on understanding of risk management
            frameworks and their practical applications. The group project,
            focused on Pampered Pets, allowed me to apply the STRIDE model to
            identify and mitigate vulnerabilities systematically. My individual
            project deepened my expertise in quantitative risk modeling, using
            Monte Carlo simulations to assess potential outcomes and financial
            impacts of risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another critical area of learning was disaster recovery planning. By
            analyzing RPO/RTO scenarios, I gained insights into designing robust
            strategies to ensure business continuity, even in adverse
            conditions. The integration of GDPR compliance into these strategies
            emphasized the importance of aligning technological solutions with
            regulatory requirements.
          </p>

          <h3>So What?</h3>
          <p>
            These experiences underscored the importance of clear communication
            and teamwork in addressing complex problems. For example, the group
            project required effective collaboration despite scheduling
            challenges. Using collaborative tools and setting clear deadlines
            helped mitigate delays and achieve a cohesive outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individually, I learned to balance technical analysis with
            actionable insights. Initially, interpreting Monte Carlo simulation
            results was challenging, but with persistence, I focused on deriving
            practical recommendations rather than overcomplicating technical
            details. This reinforced the value of critical thinking and
            adaptability in problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The module also enhanced my understanding of security and risk
            management as a dynamic field requiring continuous learning.
            Reviewing class presentation recordings highlighted diverse
            perspectives and approaches, enriching my understanding of best
            practices.
          </p>

          <h3>Now What?</h3>
          <p>
            Looking forward, I plan to build on the skills and knowledge gained
            by:
