          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This reflection focuses on my journey through the Security and Risk
            Management module, structured using Rolfe et al.’s (2001) framework:
            What?, So What?, and Now What?. It explores my experiences with the
            team project on Pampered Pets, my individual project on risk
            evaluation, class presentations, and reading materials, analyzing
            the learning outcomes and their impact on my professional
            development.
          </p>
          <h2>What?</h2>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Team Project: Pampered Pets
              <p>
                During this module, my team collaborated on a risk assessment
                report for Pampered Pets, a local pet supply business
                considering digitalization. We employed NIST SP 800-30
                (Stoneburner et al., 2002) and the STRIDE model (Shostack, 2014)
                to identify vulnerabilities in both their current operations and
                proposed e-commerce platform. My primary contributions included:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Conducting the risk and threat modeling process for the current business using STRIDE model.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Proposing a timeline for the Pampered Pets to enforce the mitigations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Review the overall reports and discuss with the other team members for the revision needed to achieve the objectives.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                This project emphasized teamwork and leveraging diverse expertise to develop actionable recommendations.
              </p>

            <li>
              Individual Project
              <p>
                Building on insights from the team project, my individual assignment evaluated Pampered Pets’ international supply chain and 
                automated warehouse system. I employed Monte Carlo simulations to model risks quantitatively and proposed mitigation strategies, 
                such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Diversifying suppliers to reduce dependency.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implementing AI-powered quality monitoring systems.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Adopting GDPR-compliant data protection measures (Wolford, 2020).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                This project deepened my understanding of quantitative risk modeling and the importance 
                of aligning technological solutions with regulatory standards.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Class Presentations
              <p>
                Although I was unable to attend the class presentations due to work commitments, I utilized the 
                recorded sessions to catch up on the content and learn from the discussions. These recordings provided 
                valuable insights into various security and risk management topics. Reviewing these sessions emphasized 
                the importance of effective communication and critical analysis, even when engaging asynchronously. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Unit Reading material
              <p>
                In reflecting on the readings across the units in this module, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the 
                diverse facets of security and risk management. The collective knowledge from these readings has not only enhanced my 
                technical understanding but also enriched my ability to analyze, evaluate, and implement effective security strategies 
                in practice.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>So What?</h2>
          <ol type = "a">
            <li>
              Learning Outcomes
              <p>
                The team project provided practical insights into risk assessment methodologies. By applying NIST SP 800-30 and STRIDE, I enhanced my ability to identify and mitigate security threats systematically. Collaborating with teammates taught me the importance of clear communication and delegation in complex projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The individual project tested my ability to independently apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. Developing Monte Carlo simulations challenged me to think critically about risk quantification and prioritize mitigation strategies based on financial impact. Additionally, aligning proposed solutions with GDPR requirements reinforced my understanding of regulatory compliance as a cornerstone of effective security management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Watching the class presentation recordings provided an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of the discussed topics. This approach allowed me to analyze complex security issues, observe the presentation styles of others, and reflect on how effectively the information was conveyed. While I missed out on live interactions, reviewing the sessions emphasized the importance of clear communication and reinforced my understanding of the practical applications of security and risk management principles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the readings from this module have provided valuable insights that have directly influenced my approach to security and risk management. This broader understanding has not only increased my confidence in applying these concepts but also reinforced the need for continuous learning and adaptation in an ever-changing security landscape.

            <li>
              Challenges and Feedback
              <p>
                One significant challenge during the team project was aligning schedules across geographically dispersed members. To address this, we utilized collaborative tools and set clear deadlines for individual tasks. Despite these efforts, occasional delays occurred, teaching me the value of contingency planning in collaborative work.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the individual project, interpreting the results of Monte Carlo simulations was initially daunting. However, through persistent analysis and iteration, I refined my approach to focus on actionable insights rather than excessive technical detail. This process underscored the importance of critical thinking and self-reliance in tackling complex problems effectively.

              Application of Learning
              <p>Looking ahead, I plan to apply these lessons in both academic and professional contexts:</p>
              <ul>

                  Enhanced Risk Assessment Skills:
                  <p>
                    I will use methodologies like NIST SP 800-30 and STRIDE to assess risks systematically in future projects. These frameworks provide a robust foundation for identifying vulnerabilities and proposing mitigations tailored to specific scenarios.

                <li>
                  Quantitative Risk Modeling:
                  <p>
                    I aim to build on my experience with Monte Carlo simulations by exploring other modeling techniques, such as Bayesian analysis. This will enable me to evaluate risks more comprehensively and support data-driven decision-making.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improved Collaboration
                  <p>
                    Recognizing the importance of effective teamwork, I will prioritize clear communication and proactive engagement in future group activities. Establishing shared goals and regular check-ins will help mitigate the challenges of distributed collaboration.

                  <p>
                    This module has significantly influenced my approach to professional growth. By addressing real-world challenges, such as aligning security practices with GDPR (Wolford, 2020), I have gained a deeper appreciation for the intersection of technical expertise and regulatory compliance. Additionally, the focus on collaborative and individual contributions has strengthened my interpersonal and problem-solving skills, which are critical in dynamic work environments.
